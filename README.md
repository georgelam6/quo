# Quo

**A single-header, zero dependency game library written in C**

This library is standalone, meaning it doesn't depend on anything that doesn't come with the operating system.

## Current features
 - Window management for Windows and X11
 - 2D rendering
 - Basic maths

## Planned features
 - Wayland and Android support
 - 3D rendering pipeline
 - Audio
 - MacOS support (This is going to take a while, as it will mean adding support for Metal as well as OpenGL, since MacOS's OpenGL support is pretty shaky).
